# Bunny game

---

This project is a game that was created inspired by my rabbit called Haru. It uses a software called [Pico-8 Fantasy console](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php#m) that uses the LUA language.

## How to build

---

There are several files with the `lua` extension in this project, but they are just examples to make the format more readable.

The most important one is the `bunny.p8` cartridge file, you need to import it into Pico-8.

For now I can't afford the software, so I'm using the [educational version](https://www.pico-8-edu.com/), to import the project just type `LOAD` in the terminal or drag the file onto the screen.
